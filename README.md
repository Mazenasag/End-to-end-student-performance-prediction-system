# Student Performance Prediction

![Alt Text](static/Capture.PNG) 

üìå **Problem Statement**

This project aims to  analyze how students' academic performance (test scores) is influenced by various factors such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Level of Education, Lunch Type, and Test Preparation Course. The goal is to build predictive models that estimate students' scores based on these variables.

üîç **Insights & Key Findings**

- **Linear Regression** & **Ridge Regression** performed the best with an R¬≤ score above 0.88.
- **Decision Tree Regressor** overfitted the training data, leading to a poor test performance.
- **Random Forest** & **XGBRegressor** showed good generalization but were slightly less efficient than Ridge Regression.
- **Lasso Regression** had the lowest performance, making it unsuitable for this dataset.
- **K-Neighbors Regressor** and **AdaBoost** performed moderately, but their R¬≤ scores suggest they are not optimal for this problem.
